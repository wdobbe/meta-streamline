I. Adding the meta-streamline layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-streamline layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-streamline layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-streamline \
    "


II. Misc
========
This layer contains recipes for the ARM DS-5 streamline gator kernel module and daemon.
The included source is from DS-5 5.27.

The makefile for the (optional) gator kernel module had to be changed to let it build with Yocto.
To remove complexity in the makefile I have moved the generation of the include file gator_src_md5.h
(that contains a md5sum of all concatenated source files) to the bitbake recipe.

The performance counters of the NXP i.MX6 SOC are turned off by default. I included a kernel module
that will turn on these counters when the module is loaded, and will turn the counters off when
the module is unloaded. This module should only be used with NXP i.MX6 SOCs.

Tested with Yocto krogoth branch and Congatec QMX6 (NXP i.MX6 SOM).
